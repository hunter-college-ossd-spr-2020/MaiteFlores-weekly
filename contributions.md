|  2   | [Updated the name and fixed the address for the selected region](https://www.openstreetmap.org/changeset/81063467)    | openstreetmap|When looking through my old neighborhood I realized that a store that had been in that location was not included in the map and the address for the building was the address for a building across the street. By scrolling through the official website for the store chain I was able to find the official address for that given store and include the name of the autoparts store.|
|  2   | [Added a clinic](https://www.openstreetmap.org/changeset/81131767)    | openstreetmap| Added a clinic that had recently opened in the neighborhood near my old high school. The address at the selected location had two addresses so I went to the official website for this clinic and used the address provided. |
|  2   | [added supermarket](https://www.openstreetmap.org/changeset/81132625) | openstreetmap| Added a supermarket included its hours and number from their official website |
|  3  | [Corrected some grammatical errors](https://github.com/hunter-college-ossd-spr-2020/cchloet-weekly/pull/5) | GitHub| Went through a peer's blog and fixed a few grammatical errors | 
|  6  | [Added Laundromat](https://www.openstreetmap.org/changeset/82032924)    | openstreetmap| I added a well known laundromat to the map. I also included the hours, however since this laundromat is owned by an older Korean couple there isn't much information to include other than the name of the location and the hours its open.|
|  6  | [Added Supermarket](https://www.openstreetmap.org/changeset/82033849)    | openstreetmap| I added a supermarket that has been in the area for years. Its a supermarket that I grew up going to and a lot of locals use that supermarket as it is in close proximity to many homes in the area.|
|  7   | [Fixed some spelling mistakes](https://github.com/hunter-college-ossd-spr-2020/MichelleLucero-weekly/pull/4)    |  GitHub   |  I went through Michelle's weekly blogs and found some minor spelling errors so I fixed them   |
|  8   | [Added general store](https://www.openstreetmap.org/changeset/82500244)    |  OpenStreetMap   |  Added a general store in my old neighborhood. This store is often busy and lots of locals visit this store   |
|  9   | [Contributed to peer's blog](https://github.com/hunter-college-ossd-spr-2020/chislee0708-weekly/pull/6) |  GitHub  |  I went through chislee0708's weekly posts. While reading through the blog for week 5 I noticed some errors such as awkward sentences and some other minor errors such as mispelling. These mistakes were a quick fix and there didn't appear to be any merge conflicts so that's even better.|
|  9   | [Saywecanfly wiki edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=SayWeCanFly&oldid=947470100) |  Wikipedia  |  I edited the wikipedia page for a singer. While his page doesn't have a lot of information about him, I chose to edit this page for that reason. There is a lot of space for edits however since this person does not have a lot of published articles most of the information is based on their music releases and social media activity. |
|  9   | [AIFL wiki edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/JaiFlores) |  Wikipedia  |  I edited the wikipedia page for the American Israel Friendship League. This is a program that I participated in in high school. When I looked up their wikipedia page I realized there wasn't much information so I decided to add some of the programs that they offer. |
|  10   | [edited peer's week2 blog](https://github.com/hunter-college-ossd-spr-2020/Nannaquin-weekly/pull/3) |  GitHub  |  When looking through Nannaquin's week2 blog I found a few misspelled words so I fixed them and I also made a slight change to the third sentence in the first paragraph|
|  10   | [edited three blogs from peer's posts](https://github.com/hunter-college-ossd-spr-2020/Mtarek7900-weekly/pull/3) |  GitHub  |  I read through some of Mtarek's blog posts and while reading I found that one or two words were misspelled. Since the misspelled words were always missing one letter, correcting the misspelled words was pretty quick and easy.|
|  10   | [David So wiki edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=David_So&action=history) | Wikipedia  | Added the streaming platforms for which David's film is available to watch.|
|  10   | [Lee's wiki edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lee_Kwang-soo&action=history) | Wikipedia  | Updated Lee's current activity in 2020.|
